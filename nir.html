                <div id="Texto pibic"><font size="5">Due to the national economic development, the production of sugarcane has a fundamental role with constant growth in production over the years. Due to the extensive time required to obtain a promising material, it is extremely important to develop and use appropriate statistical, phytotechnical and molecular techniques to optimize the selection process, enabling the development of more productive varieties with more desirable characteristics for meet the interest of the sugarcane industry. The use of platforms such as the NIR (Near-infrared) spectrometer makes it possible to advance over the bottleneck of plant genetic improvement: high-yield phenotyping.</p></font>

However, combinations between smoothing and mean on the mean , and smoothing, 1st derivative, multiplicative spreading correction and centering of the mean, also higher mean values.</p></font>

As for the root of the mean prediction square error, variations between 0.9 to 1.15 were observed. Both of the partial mean squares prediction model (PLS).</p></font>
